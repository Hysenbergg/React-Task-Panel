# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Project
- EN -> It is a small application where tasks can be added, edited and deleted like project management applications used in large projects. The [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) was used because the tasks were lost when the page was refreshed. Then, the props distributions that were mixed in the whole project were organized with the [context-api](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/context.html) method. 

- TR -> Büyük projelerde kullanılan proje yönetimi uygulamaları gibi görev ekleme, düzenleme ve silme işlemlerinin olduğu küçük bir uygulamadır. Sayfa yenileme işlemi yapıldığında görevlerin kaybolmasından dolayı [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) kullanılmıştır. Ardından bütün proje içerisinde karışık olan props dağılımları [context-api](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/context.html) yöntemi ile düzenlenmiştir.
